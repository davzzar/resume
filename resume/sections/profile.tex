I am a striving trilingual Computer Science bachelor student with an international background to specialize in Artificial Intelligence at Kingâ€™s College London. Despite my Bachelor specialization, I am keen to pursue the study of Information Security which I have begun at KCL. In addition, I am interested to open myself other diverse branches of computer science at the postgraduate level with aspirations of doctoral research thereafter. I follow the CTF hacking competition scene as a tool for education as well as self-expression. Currently, I am working on my final year project in non-monotonic reasoning under the supervision of Dr Odinaldo Rodrigues.
